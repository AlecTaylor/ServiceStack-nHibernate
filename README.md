ServiceStack-nHibernate
=======================

nHibernate (with fluent) example project exposed as an API with ServiceStack


Inspiration
===========
ServiceStack has some nice examples using their OrmLite ORM.

nHibernate has some nice examples using it's own ORM.

But I haven't found a project using ServiceStack with nHibernate as its ORM. So I'll open-source this one to help others integrate nHibernate with ServiceStack.
